Just make sure WooCommerce is pre-installed and active on your website

= Where is my menu page = 
Plugin converts your WooCommerce cart page into your menu page, so your WooCommerce cart page is converted into the menu page.

= I don't see Menu on Cart page =
Make sure you have set a cart page for your site from the WooCommerce > settings > Advanced (tab) -> Cart Page, if you have not set the cart page from WooCommerce setting then WooCommerce will show its own default cart page and this plugin won't work properly

= My Shop page is redirecting to menu page =
By default, it will redirect your shop page to your cart or menu page.
We have added this because we think you won't need shop page as all your product will be on the menu page, but if you still want that sho page then you can have our Pro version it has the option to disable this feature

Say you have a category page and you want to link them to the menu page, but you want to show the menu specific to that category then

E.g https://woo-restaurant.com/menu/?cat_id=100 
on our demo site, this will open "Magic of Basmati"
